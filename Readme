This application could be much better. 
I made it very simple, just to demonstrate functionality and learning ability.
Answering the following questions will be a great start, when considering making improvements to the web application.
1. What inputs will the client give to the interface?
2. Is the client remote or local?
3. Are there specific attributes you are interested in?
4. " ..directory size of at least 1 000 000", what is the unit?
5. Who will specify the directory to be listed? Hard coded or not?
6. Will the client be able to navigate through the listing or they will just see text?
7. Does formatting matter?
8. Should sub directories be expanded or not?
